# Statamic on DDEV
Welcome Statamic home into DDEV.

## How it Works
Go to the root directory of your Statamic installation, download the Makefile and run `make install`. You can do it in one line with:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerns/statamic-on-ddev/main/Makefile -s -o Makefile && make install
```
